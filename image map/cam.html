    <h1> More about camera </h1>

    <p id="line">
        A camera is a piece of equipment that is used for taking photographs, making films, or producing television
        pictures.
        <br>
        Many cameras are now included as part of other digital devices such as phones and tablets.
        <br>
        Technically a device that consists of a lightproof chamber with an aperture fitted with a lens and a shutter
        through
        which the image of an object is projected onto a surface for recording (as on a photosensitive film or an
        electronic
        sensor) or for translation into electrical impulses (as for television broadcast)

        <b>Componenets of a camera</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Though there are many types of cameras, all include five indispensable components:
        <br>
        (1) the camera box, which holds and protects the sensitive film from all light except that entering through the
        lens.
        <br>
        (2) film, on which the image is recorded, a light-sensitive strip usually wound on a spool, either manually or
        automatically, as successive pictures are taken.
        <br>
        (3) the light control, consisting of an aperture or diaphragm and a shutter, both often adjustable.
        <br>
        (4) the lens, which focuses the light rays from the subject onto the film, creating the image, and which is
        usually
        adjustable by moving forward or back, changing the focus.
        <br>
        (5) the viewing system, which may be separate from the lens system (usually above it) or may operate through it
        by
        means of a mirror.
