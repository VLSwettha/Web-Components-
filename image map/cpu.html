    <p id="line">Alternately referred to as a processor, central processor, or microprocessor, the CPU (pronounced
        sea-pea-you) is the central processing unit of the computer.<br>
        A computer's CPU handles all instructions it
        receives from hardware and software running on the computer.<br>
        As an example, the CPU processed the
        instructions
        to use a web browser to open and display this web page on your computer.

        <b>What does the CPU do?</b>
        <br>
        <br>

        The CPU's main function is to take input from a peripheral (keyboard, mouse, printer, etc) or computer program,
        and interpret what it needs. <br>The CPU then either outputs information to your monitor or performs the
        peripheral's requested task.<br>
