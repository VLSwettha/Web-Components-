        PC stands for personal computer.
        <br>
        PCs are multipurpose computers suited for individual end users, as opposed to high-performance computers that
        are typically reserved for IT specialists for carrying out tasks such as managing servers.
        <br>
        PCs typically run on commercial operating systems (OS), commercial software applications, and freeway and open
        source software.

        <b>TYPES OF PC'S</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        STATIONARY PC
        <br>
        <br>
        Stationary PCs remain in a single location and are more robust in size and functionality than portable PCS.
        <br>
        The two main types of stationary PCs are desktop computers and workstations.
        <br>
        --Desktop computers: The term PC has become synonymous with desktop computers. These stationary PCs are
        computers whose core components are held in a computer case, sometimes called a tower. This case is separate for
        external equipment used to operate the computer.
        <br>
        --Workstations: this refers to high-end PCs that are used for running technical, mathematical, and scientific
        applications, typically in a professional setting. They are usually connected to a larger network via a local
        area network (LAN).
        <br>
        PORTABLE PC
        <br>
        <br>
        Unlike desktop computers, portable PCs house all of the core components as well as the equipment needed to
        operate in one enclosure, including keys and a screen.
        <br>
        Some of the most common portable devices are laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
